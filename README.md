# phylogenomic_pipeline

Python code for performing a phylogenomic analysis. 

Briefly, our code will:
 - take fasta files as input
 - perform multiple sequence alignment
 - perform phylogentic analysis for each alignment
 - tally the topologies of resulting gene trees
 - create a figure summarizing results
